        <h4>India pacer Mohammad Siraj picked up his maiden ODI five-wicket haul to reduce Sri Lanka to 12 runs for the loss of six wickets in the Asia Cup final at the R.Premadasa Stadium on Sunday. 

            Siraj went wicketless in his first over which was the second of the innings overall but wreaked havoc in the fourth over, his second, of the innings as he picked up four wickets in the over. He removed Pathum Nissanka, Sadeera Samawickrama, Charith Asalanka, and Dhananjaya De Silva after Jasprit Bumrrah nicked off opener Kusal Perera in the first over of the innings.
            
            In the fourth delivery of his third over, Siraj castled Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka to become the joint-fastest bowler to take a fifer with Sri Lanka's Chaminda Vaas, and USA's Ali Khan, equalling the feat in 16 deliveries 
            
            Earlier, Sri Lanka won the toss and opted to bat.</h4></p>
